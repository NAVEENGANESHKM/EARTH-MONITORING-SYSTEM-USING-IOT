EARTHING MONITORING SYSTEM:
A cost effective solution to monitor earthing rather than relying on specialists.
-a reference earth rod is inserted into the earth deeper than the main earth rod.
-using multiple  voltage sensors(zmpt101b) and esp32s the potential difference between these rods are obtained.
-using the obtained potential difference earth resistance, leakage current can be calculated which are the major aspects of earth-rod monitoring.
-A moisture sensor is also interfaced with a esp 32, Since soil moisture can affect the earth resistance.
