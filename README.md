# EARTHING MONITORING SYSTEM:
# A cost effective solution to monitor earthing rather than relying on specialists.

1.A reference earth rod is inserted into the earth deeper than the main earth rod.
2.Using multiple  voltage sensors(zmpt101b) and esp32s the potential difference between these rods are obtained.
3.Using the obtained potential difference earth resistance, leakage current can be calculated which are the major aspects of earth-rod monitoring.
4.A moisture sensor is also interfaced with a esp 32, Since soil moisture can affect the earth resistance.
5.This project is a small scale implementation of the proposed idea.
