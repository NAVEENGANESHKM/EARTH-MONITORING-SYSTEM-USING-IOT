EARTHING MONITORING SYSTEM:
A cost effective solution to monitor earthing rather than relying on specialists.
-A reference earth rod is inserted into the earth deeper than the main earth rod.
-Using multiple  voltage sensors(zmpt101b) and esp32s the potential difference between these rods are obtained.
-Using the obtained potential difference earth resistance, leakage current can be calculated which are the major aspects of earth-rod monitoring.
-A moisture sensor is also interfaced with a esp 32, Since soil moisture can affect the earth resistance. 
-This project is a small scale implementation of the proposed idea.
